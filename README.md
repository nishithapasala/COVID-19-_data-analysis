## COVID-19 Data Analysis using Python
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 trends in India using Python and Pandas, leveraging datasets on reported cases and vaccination progress. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data, visualize trends, and understand the pandemic’s impact across different states.

## Datasets Used:

covid_19_india.csv – Contains daily COVID-19 case data across Indian states, including confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.

covid_vaccine_statewise.csv – Provides details on the vaccination rollout across Indian states, including doses administered and vaccine types.

## Analysis Performed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Cleaning, handling missing values, and summarizing key statistics.

Trend Analysis: Studying the spread of COVID-19 over time at the state and national levels.

Vaccination Impact: Analyzing the correlation between vaccination rates and case trends.

State-wise Comparisons: Identifying states with the highest and lowest cases, recovery rates, and vaccination coverage.

Visualizations: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps to showcase insights.

## Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook
